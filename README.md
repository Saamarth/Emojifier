Build the Sentiment-Classification model using two-approaches.

Python implementation of the model using averaging function and feeding it to the Neural Network.
Implementation of many-to-one RNN architecture using Tensorflow framework.
Analyzed both the approaches using different test scenarios and can conclude Approach 2 is better than Approach 1.
